# üê¨ Cetacean University

The main content of a website I built in a Wordpress learning course, made for a fictional Cetacean üê¨ University. 

The course in question is named **Become a WordPress Developer - Unlocking Power With Code**, by **Brad Schiff**. All my thanks to him!

The site is live and can be viewed on https://cetacean-university.buchara.site/

## üñåÔ∏è Themes

This repository contains **three themes** developed during my time through the course. Each one composes the same amount of page templates, with a basically the same features. 

- ### [Cetacean University Theme](./themes/cetacean-university-theme/README.md)

- ### [Cetacean University Block Theme](./themes/cetacean-university-block-theme/README.md)

## üîå Plugins 

**Three plugins** were developed by me and stored here during the course. One contains **two block types**, a **word filter** and a **post info stats**, other contains a **pet adoption table** for the sake of learning how to use custom database tables on Wordpress, and the last one is a **quiz block** using the new **Interactivity API** of Wordpress.

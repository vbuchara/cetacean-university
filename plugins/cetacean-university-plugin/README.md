# üê¨ Cetacean University Plugin üîå

A Wordpress plugin that adds a lot of features, such as a **Word Filter**, **Post Statics** and two **block types**.

It was developed during during the course I took called **Become a WordPress Developer - Unlocking Power With Code**, by **Brad Schiff**. 

## üë©‚Äçüíª Technologies

This plugin was developed using both **Typescript** and **PHP**. The modules of **Word Count** and **Word Filter** were purely done with **PHP**, while the two **block types** were all done in **Typescript**, with the help of **PHP** for setup and initial rendering.

## ‚≠ê Features

- This plugin can be separated into **4 modules**, they being:
  
  - **Word Count**: A system that injects on the content of some posts statistics. It has a configuration page that can be accessed on the **Settings** menu, on the option **Word Count**.
  
  - **Word Filter**: A word filtering system, that can replace words on some posts with a configurable placeholder. It has two configuration pages found on the menu **Word Filter** on the admin dashboard.
  
  - **Quiz Block**: A block that **editors** can setup on the posts, which displays a question and multiple answers to pick, and validates to the views which one they picked correctly or wrong. 
  
  - **Featured Professor**: A block that **editors** can setup to highlight a specific professor in a post.
  
- The **Word Count** feature has configurations for where to display, the title of the section where the information is going to be displayed, and what information to display.

  - It displays information about the **amount of words**, the **number of characters**, and **how much time it would take for someone to read** based on a simple calculus. Each one can be enabled or not.
  
  - If all information options are disabled, no section is shown on the view side.
  
- The **Word Filter** has a configuration page where words can be input in a **textarea**. It also has a configuration page for the replacement text. 

  - Each word to be filtered should be listed separated by **comma**.    
  
- The **Quiz block type** has one input field for the question, and by default comes with only one row for the answer. 

  - At least **one answer** must be present, and at most 4 answers can be in one single **Quiz block**.
  

  - Each **answer** row has buttons for **marking it as correct** and to **delete** the answer.
  
    - A **star** symbol button represents and marks a correct answer.
    
    - A **trash bin** symbol button represents the option to delete the answer.
    
  - Multiple correct answers can be picked. 
    
  - Multiple quiz blocks can be present on the same post.    
  
  - On the view side of the site, the quiz will be shown, with the question and the answers to be picked. 
    
    - A quiz shows the result as **correct** in **green** only if a **correct answer** was picked, and no **wrong answer**. It says if all correct answers were picked, or just the few selected if some was missing.
    
    - A quiz shows the result as **wrong** in a **red** sorry message if no **correct answers** were picked,or if some **correct answer** was picked alongside with a **wrong answer**.

- The **Professor Featured block type** has a **selector** containing all **Professors post type** registered on the site. 

  - Once one is picked, their information is shown on the container bellow, with their **name**, **description**, **programs offered**, and their **thumbnail image**. 
  
  - The exact same info on the **editor** is shown on the **viewer** side, with the exception of the selector, of course.

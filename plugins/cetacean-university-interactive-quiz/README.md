# üê¨ Cetacean University Interactive Quiz üîå

A Wordpress plugin that adds a new **Quiz block type**, as well as a **Solved Quizzes Counter block type** using the new **Interactivity API** of **Wordpress**.

## üë©‚Äçüíª Technologies

This project was created through the **@wordpress/create-block** tool, with the template **@wordpress/create-block-interactive-template**. It uses both **Typescript** and **PHP** to development of both blocks.

This project also uses **composer** only to download a package called `masterminds/html5` to manipulate **DOM elements**, by transpiling a file containing **HTML5**.

A **Redux store** was also used to keep track about the answers created on the **Interactive Quiz** blocks, so to correct duplication of ids that can cause problems at the **viewer side** of the site.

  - The **Solved Quizzes Counter** simply display the information of how many **Interactive Quiz** blocks were completed by the user on the **viewer** side. It only works with the **Interactivity Quiz** of this plugin.

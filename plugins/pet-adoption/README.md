# üê¨ Pet Adoption üîå

A simple Wordpress plugin that displays a table of generated pets at a page **Pet Adoption**.

It was developed for learning purposes during the course I took called **Become a WordPress Developer - Unlocking Power With Code**, by **Brad Schiff**. 

## üë©‚Äçüíª Technologies

This plugin was manly developed to learn how to setup a **custom database table** in Wordpress, and make usage of it, such as **reading** and **adding data**.

It only uses a couple of styles made with **Sass** and no actual **Javascript** code.

## ‚≠ê Features

- It includes a table of information about pets on the page **Pet Adoption** (With the slug `pet-adoption`).

    - The page needs to be created through the **admin dashboard** so it can be accessed on the site viewer.

- The list needs to be generated through an action on [**pet-adoption.php**](./pet-adoption.php) that is commented out, at the constructor of the class `Pet_Adoption_Plugin`. 

```php
add_action('admin_head', [$this, 'insert_dummy_data']);
```

- The amount of pets generated can also be edited through the variable `$numberOfPetsToCreate` on the same class.

- On the **Pet Adoption** page, it is displayed a table of pets, with the columns **Name**, **Species**, **Weight**, **Birth Year**, **Hobby**, **Favorite Food**, and **Favorite Color**.
  
  - It's also shown how many seconds the query took to take all the pets, how many pets were found in the database, and how many pets were displayed. 
  
  - The pets retrieved can be filtered through **query parameters**. The parameters available to filter are:
   
    - `pet_name`: The name of the pet
    - `species`: The species of the pet
    - `fav_food`: The favorite food of the pet
    - `fav_color`: The favorite color of the pet
    - `fav_hobby`: The favorite hobby of the pet
    - `min_year`: The minimum year for the the pet's `birth_year` to be retrieved. Only pets with birth year after that year will be taken.
    - `max_year`: The maximum year for the pet's `birth_year`. Only pets with birth year before that year will be taken.
    - `min_weight`: The minimum weight of the pet's `pet_weight` to be retrieved. Only pets that weight more than the value will be taken.
    - `max_weight`: The maximum weight of the pet's `pet_weight` to be retrieved. Only pets that weight more than the value will be taken.

- Admins of the site can access the **Pet Adoption** page and being able to either delete a row of **pet**, or add a new **pet** by inserting a **new name**. Other data of the pet will be randomly taken from a pool.
